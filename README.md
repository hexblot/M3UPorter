M3UPorter
=========

A simple tool to copy files referenced by an M3U playlist to a different folder.
It makes an effort to be quick and offer the most often requested functionality.
Build on an afternoon of frustration because I just couldn't find a tool to do 
this that worked on Windows 7.

Manual
=========

1. Can select playlist file by dragging and dropping on form
2. Select output directory or device
3. Select options
  * Prefix with playlist position will make your files be prefixed with 001 - myfile.mp3, 002 - myotherfile.mp3 etc
  * Move instead of copy - will move yoru files, so use with care!
4. Click Go!
